			<h3>Founders of Coors</h3>
			<p>In 1786, English immigrant John Molson founded Canada’s oldest beer brewery on the banks of the St. Lawrence River in Montreal. He wrote, “My beer has been universally well-liked beyond my most sanguine expectations.” The legacy continues seven generations later with brands like Molson Canadian, first brewed in 1959 and still one of Canada’s most iconic and best-selling beers.</p>
			
			<p>Adolph Coors, a penniless brewer’s apprentice, stowed away on a ship from Germany in 1868 and made his way west, coming upon perfect water in Clear Creek in Golden, Colorado, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. He opened a brewery in 1873; 105 years later, Coors Light was born and is now enjoyed by beer drinkers in over 25 countries worldwide.</p>
			
			<p>Frederick J. Miller began his apprenticeships in brewing in adolescence and by 1849 was brewmaster to a German prince. After immigrating to the U.S., he settled in Milwaukee, and in 1855 leased and later purchased the suburban Plank Road Brewery for $2,300. He brought a unique brewer’s yeast from Germany – its descendant yeast is still used in some of our beers.</p>
